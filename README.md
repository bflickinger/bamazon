## Overview

For this Demo, I've created an Amazon-like storefront called "Bamazon". The storefront is comprised of the following components:

## bamazonCustomer.js

This is a command line application that utilizes node.js and mysql to allow a customer to select and item from inventory and purchase what ever amount is desired.  If there isn't enough in stock, the customer is told as much and asked to purchase again.  If there is enough product in stock, the amount of the purchase is displayed, and the amount available is updated on the mysql server.
